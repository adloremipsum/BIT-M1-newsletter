            <p>
              For one Sundays staffer, the Dog Meets Baby course made what can
              be a stressful process seamless for all involved–human and canine.
              Read their story and consider taking this course yourself or
              gifting it to an expecting loved one!

              Use prevention year round, whatever that preventative may be. I
              just found a tick on my dog Mabel last month in February–yes, even
              with snow on the ground.
